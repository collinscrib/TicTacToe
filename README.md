# TicTacToe in C++   
Currently works as an implementation of TicTacToe on the command line. With no command line flags, it plays Player vs. Player TicTacToe with X's starting first.

**Command line args:** 
* `-a` : Play Player vs. AI
* `-t` : Run unit tests on both a predetermined set, and a set with 2 random game boards.

## **Usage:**
`g++ *.cpp -o TicTacToe` in working directory, then `./TicTacToe <-a/-t>`

### TODO:
* Add Player vs. AI Logic
